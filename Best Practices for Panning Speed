BEST PRACTICES FOR PANNING SPEED
For good reason, camera panning is one of the most popular cinematic techniques. It may, among other things, make otherwise static pictures more dynamic, give panoramas a more broader impression, and monitor the movement of a subject. However, if the panning rate, settings, or approach are not appropriate, the results may look odd. The finest strategies for enhancing results are discussed in this article. SPEED OF PANNING The actual rotation of the camera, the sensor size of the camera, and the focal length of the lens all influence the perceived panning speed. When employing a smaller sensor or a longer focal length lens, a camera must be turned more slowly to provide the same on-screen effect since smaller sensors or longer focal length lenses encompass a larger area.
